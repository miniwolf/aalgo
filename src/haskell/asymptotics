asymptotic running times.

List:
insert -> takes reverse of n elements twice -> 2 * n
remove -> simply removes 1 elements -> 1

queues as paired lists
insert -> insert takes constant times, only adds one element to right list
remove -> might take n time, but is amortized to constant time
	when only calling remove once, it takes n time

//queues as lazy paired lists
//insert and remove -> constant amortized, but worst case log n

with triple pair with pre evaluation
insert and remove -> constant time worst case
